# Website Shell Project

This is a personal project for building a website shell that could be customized depending on what someone's needs are. This project is a way to practice my skills obtained through Computer Science bachelor's degree program. This is a full stack web development project that uses an Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture with Routes. 

This project is build using primarily HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js) and Embedded JavaScript (EJS). The project can be ran completely by running the 'server.js' file using the command 
```bash
node server.js
```

Note that the program is based off localhost port running 3001. This can be changed.
The website can then be accessed by any user on the same network, by typing the URL `http://{ip-address of computer where server.js is running}:{Port No. 3001 for example}`.
